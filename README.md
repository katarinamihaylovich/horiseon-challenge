## A New Horiseon
## About 

This project was about modifying an existing html and an existing CSS in order to make the website more functional.
Most of the necessary edits involved changing semantic block elements in the html, as well as condensing and changing class rules in the CSS.
Many block elements were not specific enough initially, and many CSS rules were repetitive or redundant. 
The point of doing this project was to learn how to use semantic elements and to simplify code so that it is clearer to understand.
By doing this, I am getting into the habit of leaving my workspace cleaner than when I got there.
