## A New Horiseon
## About 

This project was about modifying an existing html and an existing CSS in order to make the website more functional.
Most of the necessary edits involved changing semantic block elements in the html, as well as condensing and changing class rules in the CSS.
Many block elements were not specific enough initially, and many CSS rules were repetitive or redundant.
